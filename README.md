<h1>Object-Oriented-Programming</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project shows off my ability to implement object oriented programming. It consist of 3 files. The first file "acme.py" creates an object named Product with the attributes name, price, weight, flammability, and identifier. There are two methods that use the attributes of Product as their parameters, and returns certain results based on said parameters. I've also created a child object called Boxing Glove which uses the same attributes. This object also has 2 additional methods that use the child objects attributes.</p>

<p>The second file is titled "acme_report.py" and it contains two functions. The first one makes use of the Product object created in "acme.py" to randomly generate a certain amount of products and returns them in a list. The second function returns the number of unique names in the list, the average price, the average weight, and the average flammability of the items in the list, and returns these values in a tuple.</p>

<p>The third file is titled "acme_test.py" and it runs four asserts on "acme.py" to ensure that the product class is set up with the proper default values and data types.</p>
